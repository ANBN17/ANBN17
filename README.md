## Niraj Neupane

Quantitative researcher with a background in financial economics, financial engineering, and professional accounting. My work focuses on systematic trading, derivatives, and risk analytics, combining economic intuition with statistical rigor and production-oriented research workflows. I am particularly interested in building robust, risk-aware quantitative models that translate empirical research into repeatable trading and risk-management systems.

## Research Focus

My quantitative work spans the full research lifecycle:
- Market data acquisition and feature engineering
- Strategy research and hypothesis testing
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation
- Portfolio construction and drawdown control
- Paper trading, execution logic, and monitoring
- Machine learning applications for trading and risk

I primarily work with futures, equities, and options, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and scalability.

## Quantitative Research Projects

### 1. Market Data Analysis and PnL Modeling  
Developed Python-based pipelines to process raw market data and compute returns, volatility, PnL attribution, and drawdowns. Emphasis on clean data handling, performance diagnostics, and exploratory market behavior analysis.

### 2. Systematic Trading Strategy and Backtesting  
Designed and backtested systematic strategies using historical data. Evaluated performance using risk-adjusted metrics, stability across regimes, and sensitivity to parameter choices.

### 3. Futures Trend-Following and Risk Management  
Built trend-following strategies on futures contracts incorporating volatility targeting, leverage control, contract rollovers, and drawdown-based risk limits.

### 4. Options Strategy and Volatility Analysis  
Modeled option payoffs and Greeks. Analyzed implied versus realized volatility and evaluated option strategies under different volatility and market regime assumptions.

### 5. Machine Learning for Trading Signal Evaluation  
Applied machine learning models to financial time-series for signal evaluation. Focused on feature engineering, walk-forward validation, and avoiding overfitting in predictive models.

### 6. Automated Paper Trading and Execution Workflow  
Implemented automated paper-trading systems integrating strategy signals, execution logic, PnL tracking, and real-time risk monitoring to simulate live trading environments.

### 7. Risk-Based Quantitative Modeling and ML Risk Forecasting  
Developed risk-focused models incorporating volatility forecasting, Value-at-Risk, Conditional VaR, stress testing, and machine-learning-based risk estimation frameworks.
