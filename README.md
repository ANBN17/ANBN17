# 💫 About Me:

I am currently working on  
Research-driven systematic trading strategies, derivatives modeling, and risk-based quantitative frameworks, with an emphasis on robustness, drawdown control, and real-world applicability.

I am looking to collaborate on  
Quantitative research projects involving systematic trading, futures and options strategies, risk analytics, and machine learning applied to financial markets.

I am looking for help with  
Improving execution realism, transaction cost modeling, and scaling research prototypes into production-ready trading and risk systems.

I am currently learning  
Advanced volatility modeling, portfolio risk aggregation, machine-learning methods for time-series, and execution-aware strategy design.

Ask me about  
Systematic trading research, futures and options modeling, backtesting frameworks, risk metrics, and applied quantitative finance.

Fun fact  
I combine a Chartered Accountant background with quantitative finance to design trading and risk systems that are both statistically rigorous and financially realistic.
