# About Me

I am a quantitative researcher with a background in financial economics, financial engineering, and professional accounting. My work focuses on systematic trading, derivatives, and risk analytics, combining economic intuition with statistical rigor and research workflows designed for real-world applicability. I am particularly interested in building robust, risk-aware quantitative models that translate empirical research into repeatable trading and risk-management systems.

## Quantitative Research Projects

### 1. Market Data Analysis and PnL Modeling  
Developed Python-based pipelines to process raw market data and compute returns, volatility, PnL attribution, and drawdowns. Emphasis on clean data handling, performance diagnostics, and exploratory market behavior analysis.

### 2. Systematic Trading Strategy and Backtesting  
Designed and backtested systematic strategies using historical data. Evaluated performance using risk-adjusted metrics, stability across regimes, and sensitivity to parameter choices.

### 3. Futures Trend-Following and Risk Management  
Built trend-following strategies on futures contracts incorporating volatility targeting, leverage control, contract rollovers, and drawdown-based risk limits.

### 4. Options Strategy and Volatility Analysis  
Modeled option payoffs and Greeks. Analyzed implied versus realized volatility and evaluated option strategies under different volatility and market regime assumptions.

### 5. Machine Learning for Trading Signal Evaluation  
Applied machine learning models to financial time-series for signal evaluation. Focused on feature engineering, walk-forward validation, and avoiding overfitting in predictive models.

### 6. Automated Paper Trading and Execution Workflow  
Implemented automated paper-trading systems integrating strategy signals, execution logic, PnL tracking, and real-time risk monitoring to simulate live trading environments.

### 7. Risk-Based Quantitative Modeling and ML Risk Forecasting  
Developed risk-focused models incorporating volatility forecasting, Value-at-Risk, Conditional VaR, stress testing, and machine-learning-based risk estimation frameworks.
